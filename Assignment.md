## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

| Key Concept | How it Helped My Portfolio Project |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| **Branching** | Allowed me to develop each section (Hero, About, Projects, Skills) in isolated feature branches, preventing code conflicts and keeping `main` stable. |
| **Pull Requests & Code Reviews** | Made it easy to request feedback from peers before merging; ensured every change was tested and approved, improving overall code quality. |
| **GitHub Actions / Workflows** | Automated the build-and-deploy pipeline: every push to `main` triggers a workflow that installs dependencies, runs a simple build check, and publishes the site to GitHub Pages—no manual deployment needed. |
| **Issues & Milestones** | Helped me break the portfolio into manageable tasks (navigation bar, responsive layout, styling polish), link them to a milestone, and track progress transparently. |
| **Project Board (Kanban)** | Visualised task flow (To Do → In Progress → Done), kept me focused on one feature at a time, and provided a clear overview of project status at a glance. |
